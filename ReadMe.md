******  About SPM  *******

SPM is a simple crud app built in ASP.net MVC to help students easily manage their assignments, due dates and grades. 


******* NOTES ********

Project structure is a little sloppy as I was learning the mvc framework, as well as the entity framework. Have a much better understanding of this now.
Improving project architecture is something that I'd like to revisit. 

I by passed some of the built in services as they were fairly over kill for something this small. In this case it actually would have over complicated 
the project to use them. The application could benefit from using the built in ajax services and http requests to avoid page loads.
